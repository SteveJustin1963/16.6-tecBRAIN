\\ In this revised version:

\\The sigmoid function is more clearly defined.
\\Comments have been added for clarity.
\\The train-linear and train-ridge functions have been corrected and clarified.
\\The reservoir-computing function now properly iterates over the timesteps.
\\Remember, this code is a basic representation and should be adapted for practical use, including providing 
\\ actual values for the variables and weight matrices. The sigmoid function here is also quite simple and 
\\ might need to be replaced with a more accurate implementation for real-world applications.
