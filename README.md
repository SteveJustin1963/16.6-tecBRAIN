We use the concept called Reservoir computing, which in simple terms is a methid to induce a continuous echo in a medium, and long enough for a systematic pattern to form that in a way expands the complex input signal into a more recognisable pattern. 

induced piezoelectric silicon jelly and special circuits. 
* Forth AI code and tec-APUS create simple learning and behavior system.


 
Build a brain using Reservoir Computing method based on echo networks.  
 
Using Reservoir Computing methods may be way forward to simplify processing of complex input patterns. Expanding inputs into more dimensions allows neural computational techniques using Forth code. 

 
The piezo-electric transducers send and receive echoes within a silicon jelly regular shape. Input signals are expanded and analyzed with Forth AI code.  and drivers on TEC-1 and tec-APUS with AI Forth code create simple learning and behavior system.
